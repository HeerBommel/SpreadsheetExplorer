# 1) Analyze array formulas

Open file AnalyzeArray.xlsm. The VBA reads spreadsheets to analyze from folder C:\Input en saves a copy of spreadsheets with array formulas in C:\output. These paths are stored in global constants FOLDER_TO_ANALYZE and FOLDER_TO_SAVE and can easily be changed in the VBA editor. To start the analysis you can start the macro 'Demo'. You can either start the macro via the developer tab on the ribbon or with the shortcut [alt] + [F8].
